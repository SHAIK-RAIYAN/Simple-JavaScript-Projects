# Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

A simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project focuses on delivering a clean, responsive design and a smooth user experience. It’s an ideal demonstration of modern front-end techniques without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

## 🔍 Features and Techniques

- **CSS Grid Layout**: The game board uses [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) to create a flexible 3x3 layout.
- **Event Handling**: JavaScript's [EventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener) is used to handle player interactions.
- **Game Logic**:
  - Winner detection using predefined win patterns.
  - Draw condition detection when all cells are filled without a winner.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**:
  - Game messages update dynamically to announce winners or draws.
  - Buttons disable after being clicked to prevent overwriting moves.
- **CSS Animations**: A smooth [keyframe animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) for the winner announcement.
